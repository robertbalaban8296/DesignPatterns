The Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms (in our cases, behaviors), encapsulate each one,
and make the interchangeable.

Key words:
    - change behavior at run time
    - composition
    - favor composition over inheritance
    - program to an interface, not an implementation
    - identify the aspects that vary and separates them from what stays the same
